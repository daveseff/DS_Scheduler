Apache Web server

Python >= 2.6

Point your web server to the 'web' directory that is under scheduler/.  If you installed in /opt/scheduler, then an example apache entry would be:

Alias /scheduler/ /opt/scheduler/web/
<Directory /opt/scheduler/web/>
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "DS_SChed"
   AuthUserFile /opt/scheduler/.htpasswd
   require valid-user
</Directory>

Secure your site by using SSL and htpasswd. You can run root processes with the scheduler to restricting access is highly recommended.

Creating an htpasswd file:

htpasswd -c /opt/scheduler/.htpasswd <user>

 Create the Database

Create a mysql user and a blank DB called "ds-scheduler" in MySQL. Make sure to update the sched_config.py and the dbconfig.php files to reflect the database user, host, and passwd.

Note for version 0.5 and later:

The sched_master application will create and upgrade the database tables. The goal here it to avoid doing any DB maintenance to allow for very easy upgrades.
